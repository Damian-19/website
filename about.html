		<p id="para">My name is Emma Larkin, and I am the founder of “Emma Larkin Books” and 
			“Rebel in Kerry Press”. I have recently written and published my first 
			book “Izzy’s Magical Football Adventure”, and I hope to write many more 
			books about Izzy and her adventures in sport. As may be evident from the 
			name of my publishing imprint, I am a “Rebel in Kerry”! This means that I 
			am originally from County Cork in Ireland, which is known as the Rebel 
			County, but I moved to Kerry (another county in Ireland which neighbours 
			Cork) in 2006 and have been happily living in Kerry since then, with my 
			husband and four children. My husband is a Kerry native and we live in 
			North Kerry, near Listowel, where my husband is from, and is an area which 
			is rich is literary history!
			I have always enjoyed reading and writing. Writing essays was my favourite 
			part of primary school!
			<br /><br />In my spare time, I love to run. I am very involved in my local parkrun in 
			Listowel. I also coach ladies’ football at underage level with my local ladies’ 
			football club and did attempt to play ladies football for a few years with my 
			local “Gaelic4Mothers&Others Team”! I may not have been the greatest football 
			player, but I could run! And it was an hour each week where I could exercise 
			in a fun environment with a fantastic group of women, who I remain friends with 
			to this day.
			<br /><br />My inspiration to write this book was my grandmother, Maureen Hennebry, née 
			Cashman. She was on the Cork camogie team which won the All-Ireland Camogie 
			Championship three times in row between 1939 and 1941. She came from a family 
			rich in GAA history, the Cashman’s of Blackrock in Cork, and is even mentioned 
			in the following poem by the famous Irish poet, Patrick Kavanagh:</p>
				<h4>Camogie Match</h4>
				<h6> <i>Patrick Kavanagh 1905 - 1967</i> </h6>
				<img id="ppoem" class="img-fluid" src="images/maureen-poem.jpg" alt="Maureen Cashman" />
				<p id="poem">“Bright shone the sunlight on Peggy and Doreen<br />
					Wild swung the ash sticks. Be careful astoreen;<br />
					Josie is getting into her stride now,<br />
					Kathleen is hurling with all her Cork pride now.<br />
					A shout from the side-line: Mark your man, Kathleen Cody.<br />
					Kathleen pucks it. I tell you that puck was a dotie.<br />
					The game is exciting, it is indeed really,<br />
					Maureen Cashman is tackling the bold Ide O’Kiely …“<br />
				</p>
			<br />
			<p id="para">In hindsight, I am in awe of the fact that my grandmother and her 
				teammates played camogie at such a high level at a time in Ireland, 
				where a woman’s role was predominantly to be a wife and homemaker. 
				Which comes to my reason for writing this book, my grandmother was my 
				inspiration to write it, but my reason for writing it was to encourage
				all young girls to play sports. It is crucial for our wellbeing and 
				development and we need to make it as normal for girls to play sport 
				as it is for boys. The growing popularity of women’s sports in 
				Ireland and further afield is so encouraging and we need to continue 
				to develop this. As the current 20*20 campaign says, “if she can’t 
				see it, she can’t be it”. 
				<br /><br />
				I hope that my book can in some way help to normalise girls playing 
				football and that both boys and girls will enjoy reading about Izzy’s 
				adventures!
